***I have put my other project in this folder under G00297086(2) as you never got back to tell me which would get me the most marks***
			

-Here I have created a mobile application to help young professionals to track their daily calorie intake.

-Firstly this app displays the calories in common everyday foods that young Irish adults eat. 

-Secondly, it allows the user input the amount of calories they are consuming.

-Finally, this app contains a table indicating the recommended amount of calories for both sexes and different ages.

-I have included an ion header at the top of my application

***Page 1***
-On my home page which is my home page I have a 3 tab menu which has a 'Home' tab, a 'Calories in Common Foods' tab and a 'Recommended Calorie Intake' tab.
-I have a speech bubble on my home page just indicating what calories are and how they work.
-At the bottom of the first page i have an image of fruit and vegetables spelling 'eat right'


***Page 2***
-On my second page which is my 'Calories in Common Foods' I have a table which consistes on foods, sizes of the portion and the amount of calories in the portion
-I have made the table transparent so that you can see the image behind it 
-I have put another eat right image on this page 
-I have also inserted a calculator at the bottom of this page so that users can add up how many calories they are consuming


***Page 3***
-On my third page I have another table that consistes of Gender, Age and Calories needed
-This table has columns which shows the user the sex and age of a person and then shows the recommended amount of calories that person needs per day
-I have made the table transparent so that you can see the image behind it 
-I again included the Eat Right image behind my table


			***Mobile Programming calorie project with ion tabs***Paul Dolan***G00297086***
			
-I made an ionic tabs project also however I could not get all my code working in it

-This is similar to my other project however it just has 2 ionic tabs

***Page 1***
-On the first page which I have named "Calorie Intake" I have a similar table that shows the user the food, the size of the portion and the amount of calories it contains
-It also has a calculator for the user to add up the amoun of calories they are consuming

***Page 2***
-On the second page I have another table that consistes of Gender, Age and Calories needed
-This table has columns which shows the user the sex and age of a person and then shows the recommended amount of calories that person needs per day
-I have included the Eat Right image beneath my table
